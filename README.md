## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Thinking before implimenting CSS saves time, but too much thinking is not good either.

### Continued development

Detecting which color to use was a bit tricky for me. I need to explore tools
that could help and assist me with it for the future.
And i also would love the explore a tool that tells me which css classes i haven't used and which are not implimented

### Useful resources

- [CSS Scan](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) - This helped me for setting up box shadow with just a click.
- [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - The perfect place for CSS Rest.
